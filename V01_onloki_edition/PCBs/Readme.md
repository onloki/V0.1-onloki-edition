# V0.1 Frame and Toolhead PCB

The PCBs are meant to be used togethe. They share the Molex Micro Fit 2x7 and be connected by these.

I am not an electrical engineer therefore: Custom build and use at your own risk!

# Pinout

The pin assignment is very similar but not identical! So pls use your brain or wait for the Pinout diagram.
