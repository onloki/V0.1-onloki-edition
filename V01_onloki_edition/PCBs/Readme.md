# V0.1 Frame and Toolhead PCB

The PCBs are meant to be used togethe. They share the Molex Micro Fit 2x7 and be connected by these.

I am not an electrical engineer therefore: Custom build and use at your own risk!

# Pinout

The pin assignment from the Molex connectors is very similar but not identical! So please use your brain when connecting the boards or waiting for the pinout diagram.
