# V0.1 Frame PCB

Inspired by the original V0_Umbilical by timmi99 (https://github.com/timmit99/Voron-Hardware/tree/V0-Umbilical/V0-Umbilical). I just took the footprint, so pinout and placemend of the connectors is different!

# BOM

For the PCB:
- 1x Molex 43045-1400 (Microfit 2x7) 
- 8x JST XH 2 Pin, XH2P ST
- 5x JST XH 4 Pin, XH4P ST
- 1x Screw Terminal with 5mm Pitch

Connectors for the cabels:
- 1x Molex 43045-1412 (Microfit 2x7)
- 8x JST PH 2 Pin, XH2P BU (NEMA 14 A and B motor comes often with JST XH 4pin conector, so if you do not want to cut them, you need only 6 connectors)
- 5x JST PH 4 Pin, XH4P BU
- 2x crimp ferrules for your wire

But you need also the connectors for your mcu...

# Pinout

Pinout graphics will come soon...

# Cover

There is a Cover to preventing the cables and PFTE to hit the timing belt.
