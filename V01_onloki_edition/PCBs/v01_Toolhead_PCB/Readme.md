# V0.1 Toolhead PCB

Inspired by the Pancake board by Christoph MÃ¼ller (https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_pancake_board). I just simplified the PCB for my needs.

NOTE: This is not a Pancake Board! It share only the same outer dimensions and placement of some connectors (differend Pinout!)

# BOM

For the PCB:
- 1x Molex 43045-1400 (Microfit 2x7) 
- 1x Molex 43045-0200 (Microfit 2x1)
- 5x JST PH 2 Pin, B2B-PH-K-S(LF)(SN)
- 1x JST PH 4 Pin, B4B-PH-K-S(LF)(SN)

Connectors for your cables:
- 1x Molex 43025-1400 (Microfit 2x7)
- 1x Molex 43025-0200 (Microfit 2x1)
- 5x JST PH 2 Pin, PH2P BU
- 1x JST PH 4 Pin, PH4P BU

# Pinout

Pinout graphics will come soon...
